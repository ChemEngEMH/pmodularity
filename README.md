# pmodularity
Script for digital process graph, detecting process modules and getting modularity.
To use it:
1. Create a csv file with stream list witht the structure as in the example
2. Create a csv file with node list and data, see example
3. Run the code with csv files as inputs and get a file with process modularity and module membership results
The code also generates and plots the process graph with the modules identified with different colors
Enjoy!
