# pmodularity
Script for digital process graph, detecting process modules and getting modularity.
To use it:
1. Create a csv file with stream list witht the structure as in the example (biodieselNet.csv)
2. Create a csv file with node list and data, see example (Equipment_data.csv)
3. Run the code with csv files as inputs and get a file (modularity_results.csv) with process modularity and module membership results
The code also generates and plots the process graph with the modules identified with different colors
Enjoy!
